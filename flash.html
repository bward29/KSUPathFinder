First-year students are assigned to professional advisors in the University Advising Center, while upper-division students work with faculty advisors in their major department. Advising appointments are required before registration each semester to review your academic progress and obtain your registration PIN. It's recommended to prepare for these meetings by reviewing your degree audit and creating a tentative schedule. You can schedule advising appointments through the student portal.";
